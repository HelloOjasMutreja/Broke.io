# Refactor Summary: Board/Game Schema and Auto-Initialization

## Overview
This refactor modernizes the Broke.io board and game schema, implementing a cleaner separation of concerns between board layout, tile definitions, and properties (cities).

## What Was Changed

### 1. New BoardPosition Model
**Purpose**: Map board positions to game content (tiles or cities)

**Key Features**:
- Replaces `BoardTile` as the primary board-placement model
- Supports both `tile` (for special tiles) and `city` (for properties)
- Enforces validation: exactly one of (tile, city) must be set
- `unique_together = ("board", "position")` constraint

**Code**:
```python
class BoardPosition(models.Model):
    board = models.ForeignKey(Board)
    position = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    tile = models.ForeignKey(Tile, null=True, blank=True)
    city = models.ForeignKey(City, null=True, blank=True)
    # Validation enforces: tile XOR city
```

### 2. Removed TileType.CITY
**Rationale**: Properties (cities) have distinct attributes from other tiles

**Before**: `TileType.CITY` was an enum value
**After**: Properties are exclusively modeled via `City` model with OneToOne to `Tile`

**TileType enum now includes**:
- UTILITY, CHANCE, TREASURE, TAX, START, JAIL, GO_TO_JAIL, FREE_PARKING, VACATION, CUSTOM

### 3. Automatic Board Initialization
**Purpose**: Auto-create special positions when boards are created

**Implementation**:
- `Board.initialize_positions()` method (idempotent)
- `post_save` signal triggers initialization on board creation
- Special positions created at fixed indices:
  - start = 0
  - prison = n - 1
  - vacation = 2n - 1
  - go_to_prison = 3n - 1

**Key Properties**:
- **Transactional**: Uses `transaction.atomic()`
- **Idempotent**: Safe to call multiple times
- **Non-destructive**: Won't overwrite existing custom positions

### 4. Management Command
**Command**: `python manage.py brokeio_seed_board --board-id=<id>`

**Features**:
- Initialize or re-initialize board positions
- `--force` flag to clear existing positions
- Displays summary of created positions
- Safe to use in production

### 5. Enhanced Game Model
**Verification**: Game is already a per-session model (no changes needed)

**Updated Methods**:
- `initialize_board_state()` now works with both `BoardPosition` (new) and `BoardTile` (legacy)
- Creates `GameBoardTileState` entries for all board positions
- Supports backwards compatibility during migration

## Backwards Compatibility

### Legacy Support
1. **BoardTile model preserved**: Marked as deprecated but still functional
2. **Dual schema support**: `GameBoardTileState` has both `board_tile` and `board_position` fields
3. **Graceful fallback**: Code checks for new schema first, falls back to legacy

### Migration Path
1. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate game`
2. Create data migration to convert `BoardTile` → `BoardPosition`
3. Update `GameBoardTileState` references
4. (Optional) Remove legacy fields after verification

See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Database Changes

### New Tables
- `game_boardposition`: Maps positions to tiles or cities

### Modified Tables
- `game_tile`: Removed CITY from tile_type choices
- `game_gameboardtilestate`: Added `board_position` field (nullable)
- `game_boardtile`: Made `board_tile` field nullable in GameBoardTileState

### Constraints Added
- `unique_together = ("board", "position")` on BoardPosition
- Model-level validation for tile XOR city

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **50 tests total**, all passing ✅
- New test classes added:
  - `BoardPositionModelTest`: Creation, validation, constraints
  - `BoardInitializationTest`: Auto-init, idempotency, special tiles
  - `TileTypeTest`: Enum changes verification
  - `GameBoardTileStateNewSchemaTest`: New schema integration

### Test Results
```
Ran 50 tests in 9.587s
OK
```

## Security Review

### CodeQL Analysis
```
Analysis Result for 'python'. Found 0 alert(s):
- python: No alerts found.
```

### Security Measures
- ✅ No SQL injection risks (Django ORM used correctly)
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities (no rendering of user input)
- ✅ Proper validation at model level
- ✅ Transaction safety for multi-row operations
- ✅ No exposed secrets or credentials

## Documentation

### Files Created
1. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** (10KB)
   - Step-by-step migration instructions
   - Code examples for before/after
   - Rollback plan
   - Data migration templates

2. **BOARD_POSITION_README.md** (10KB)
   - Usage examples
   - API design recommendations
   - Architecture decisions
   - Validation rules

3. **REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - High-level overview
   - Testing and security results

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Board
```python
# Create board - special positions auto-created
board = Board.objects.create(name="Classic", size=10)

# Special positions are at: 0, 9, 19, 29
```

### Adding Properties
```python
tile = Tile.objects.create(title="Park Place", tile_type=TileType.CUSTOM)
city = City.objects.create(tile=tile, base_price=350, rent_base=35)
BoardPosition.objects.create(board=board, position=37, city=city)
```

### Adding Special Tiles
```python
chance = Tile.objects.create(title="Chance", tile_type=TileType.CHANCE)
BoardPosition.objects.create(board=board, position=7, tile=chance)
```

### Creating Games
```python
game = Game.objects.create(board=board, owner=user)
game.initialize_board_state()  # Creates per-game tile states
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- **Bulk creation**: Uses `bulk_create()` for BoardPosition entries
- **Transaction grouping**: All multi-row operations wrapped in transactions
- **Query efficiency**: Uses `select_related()` for foreign keys
- **Idempotent design**: Checks for existing records before creating

### Scalability
- No N+1 query issues
- Database constraints prevent duplicates
- Signal uses `transaction.on_commit()` to avoid race conditions

## API Compatibility

**Status**: No existing APIs to maintain

**Future API Design**: See BOARD_POSITION_README.md for recommended structure

**Recommendation**: When implementing APIs, expose:
```json
{
  "board": {...},
  "positions": [
    {"position": 0, "type": "tile", "tile": {...}},
    {"position": 1, "type": "city", "city": {...}}
  ],
  "tile_states": [...]
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Signal in Tests**: `transaction.on_commit()` doesn't fire in test transactions
   - **Workaround**: Tests call `board.initialize_positions()` manually
   - **Impact**: No impact on production; tests still comprehensive

2. **Legacy Model Overhead**: `BoardTile` model still exists
   - **Rationale**: Backwards compatibility during migration
   - **Future**: Can be removed after full migration

## Next Steps

### For Immediate Use
1. ✅ Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate game`
2. ✅ Use new BoardPosition model for new boards
3. ✅ Test with management command: `brokeio_seed_board`

### For Migration (When Ready)
1. Create data migration to convert existing boards
2. Update any custom code using BoardTile
3. Test thoroughly in staging
4. Deploy to production
5. (Optional) Remove legacy fields

### For Future Development
1. Implement REST APIs using new schema
2. Add board templates/presets
3. Consider position validation (all positions filled)
4. Add position grouping (color groups, etc.)
